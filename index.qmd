## Math Equation

### Inline

An allocation A is envy-free if, for every pair of agents $i, j \in N$, it holds that

### Non-inline

$$v_{i}(A_{i}) \ge v_{i}(A_{j})$$

The concept of EFX was first introduced in 1996 by Brams and Taylor[@brams1996fair], who presented an algorithm for finding an EFX allocation for divisible goods. Since then, several extensions and variations of EFX have been proposed, including those by Lipton et al. (2004)[@lipton2004approximately].
